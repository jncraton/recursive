Recursive Example Problems
==========================

This repository contains a number of example functions that can be implemented recursively. The functions are found in `recursive.py`. They are currently implemented iteratively. Your task is to refactor the functions to be recursive.

Tests are included to confirm that functions work correctly. All tests should passing when you start, and all tests should be passing when you finish. Tests can be run using:

```
make
```

or

```
python3 -m doctest recursive.py
```
